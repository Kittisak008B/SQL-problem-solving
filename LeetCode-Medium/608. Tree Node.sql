-- Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
-- "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
-- "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
-- "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
-- Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.
-- Return the result table in any order.

-- Example 1:
-- Input: 
-- Tree table:
-- +----+------+
-- | id | p_id |
-- +----+------+
-- | 1  | null |
-- | 2  | 1    |
-- | 3  | 1    |
-- | 4  | 2    |
-- | 5  | 2    |
-- +----+------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+-------+
-- | id | type  |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | Root  |
-- | 2  | Inner |
-- | 3  | Leaf  |
-- | 4  | Leaf  |
-- | 5  | Leaf  |
-- +----+-------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
-- Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
-- Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.
  
-- Example 2:
-- Input: 
-- Tree table:
-- +----+------+
-- | id | p_id |
-- +----+------+
-- | 1  | null |
-- +----+------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+-------+
-- | id | type  |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | Root  |
-- +----+-------+
-- Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT id, CASE 
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN p_id IN (SELECT id FROM Tree) AND id IN (SELECT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
           END AS type
FROM Tree
