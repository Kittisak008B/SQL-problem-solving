-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
WITH t1 AS (SELECT a1.id,a1.name,a1.salary,a1.managerid ,
                   a2.name manager_name,a2.salary manager_salary
            FROM Employee a1
            JOIN Employee a2
            ON a1.managerId = a2.id
            )
SELECT name AS Employee 
FROM t1
WHERE salary > manager_salary
